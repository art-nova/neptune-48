# Neptune-48
Game project by two Software Engineering students for a practical NaUKMA course. Written with standard Java libraries. Influenced by recent events in Ukraine.

Project is based on a popular game "2048" viewed from a new angle: major elements of gameplay include using game tiles to attack enemies
and strategically selecting a limited number of abilities for each level to beat it more easily. The game features 2 difficulties with 6 levels per difficulty,
with each subsequent level unlocking after completion of the previous one.
